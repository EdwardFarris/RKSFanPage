Description: This was one of my very first pages I created to exercise my knowledge of html and css. I simply like the band and decided to create a fan page for others who may share my musical interests. This was a great opportunity to practice page layout, google fonts, embedding a YouTube video, making an unordered list, arrainging and resizing images, etc.
